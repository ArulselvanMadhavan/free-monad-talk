* Free Monads
** Tail Call Elimination

   - TCE is limited to self recursive methods
   - Trampoline as a general solution for TCE
   - With trampolines, no need for call stack?
** Trampoline
   - Each step yields to a single control loop
   - Stack for heap
   - Monad - transforms any call into a tail call that can be eliminated
** Example 1
